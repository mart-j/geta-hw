1. Task

If the layout is already made for desktop devices I would take a look at Chrome dev tools and would try to resize the window to 767px (max-width for tablet devices). At 767px in the given example, I would hide the sidebar in the hamburger menu with media queries and move the logo to the top section.
Then I would resize the window to 480px to see how does the website looks on the small screens. Would hide search input till user clicks on the search icon, would replace navigation with a hamburger menu, center all main content, would hide preferences, administration, and logout link under some icon.
